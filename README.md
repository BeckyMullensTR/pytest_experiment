# Pytest Experiment 

The CS Connect AI Fraud project expects to make extensive use of python scripts. We would therefore like to ensure that we have a means of unit testing these. We should be able to run the unit tests automatically. It would be ideal if the tests had to pass before a pull request could be accepted.

This repository was set up as a place to practice automating test runs.
